 When I was two, my parents and I walked right into a wild elephant. Strangers that sounds and counters with elephants are not uncommon in Sri Lanka, home to the world's second largest Asian elephant population. But with shrinking forest cover forcing more elephants into human habitat, Sri Lanka also records the highest number of elephant deaths annually due to what is called human elephant conflict. 470 elephants were killed just last year. Counting elephant deaths is essential for conservation, but there are only one among many tales of human elephant entanglements. My research aims to move beyond the conflict framework by uncovering and analyzing these stories to better understand the broader social context in which humans and elephants coexist. I use three different but interrelated methods. Interviews archival research and textual analysis. One, I interview people living in an area where visits from wild elephants is a nightly occurrence. This allows me to map how the people most affected understand the elephants, negotiate sharing terrain with them and how their elephant-related grievances are in fact related to broader social issues such as rural poverty and uneven development. Two, I engage in archival research that uncovers the longer histories of conflict and coexistence. For example, the British colonizers built some of the island's main roadways on elephant trails because the animals already knew the best way to navigate difficult terrain. But even today, these roads are frequent sites of negative interactions. Three, I analyze artistic and literary portrayals of elephants to understand their cultural significance and to speculate alternative ways of living with them. These stories reveal that human elephant entanglements are deeply entrenched in social, economic and political processes. This broader picture can facilitate policies that integrate elephant conservation and human well-being. Counting elephant deaths draws attention to the crisis. And by bringing human lives into the picture, the stories that I uncover open more just ways of coexisting. Thank you.
