0:00:00----> 0:00:14.640000
Hello CNN10 family, wonderful Wednesday to you.

2
0:00:14.640000----> 0:00:15.640000
I'm Koy Weyer.

3
0:00:15.640000----> 0:00:17.760000
Thank you for making us part of your day.

4
0:00:17.760000----> 0:00:22.800000
Only 550 more seconds left in this show, so let's make the most of them and let's go.

5
0:00:22.800000----> 0:00:26
Now we start with some concerning moments for the people of Japan.

6
0:00:26----> 0:00:30.880000
On Tuesday, Japan urged its residents to take shelter after North Korea fired a ballistic

7
0:00:30.880000----> 0:00:35.480000
missile over the country for the first time in five years and without warning.

8
0:00:35.480000----> 0:00:40.200000
The action prompted immediate backlash from neighboring South Korea and allies around the

9
0:00:40.200000----> 0:00:41.200000
world.

10
0:00:41.200000----> 0:00:45.600000
The missile is a potentially dangerous escalation of recent weapons tests by the Kim Jong-un

11
0:00:45.600000----> 0:00:47.920000
regime which governs North Korea.

12
0:00:47.920000----> 0:00:50.520000
The country has been conducting a lot of missile tests.

13
0:00:50.520000----> 0:00:53.560000
There have been five launches in the past 10 days.

14
0:00:53.560000----> 0:00:57.360000
And Tuesday's launch marked their 23rd missile test this year.

15
0:00:57.360000----> 0:01:01.460000
There were no reports of damage, but the unannounced missile triggered a rare nationwide

16
0:01:01.460000----> 0:01:04.120000
alert system in Japan.

17
0:01:04.120000----> 0:01:08.720000
Experts say Tuesday's launch could be the start of more intense actions from North Korea.

18
0:01:08.720000----> 0:01:13
The president of South Korea said that North Korea will have to quote, pay the price for

19
0:01:13----> 0:01:17.540000
their actions, but the ability to punish North Korea is limited because of resistance from

20
0:01:17.540000----> 0:01:20.040000
China and Russia.

21
0:01:20.040000----> 0:01:24.480000
Next up, we'll go to the country of Somalia where families are wondering when or if their

22
0:01:24.480000----> 0:01:26
next meal will come.

23
0:01:26----> 0:01:30.600000
The East African nation is facing tremendous drought and the effects have been devastating.

24
0:01:30.600000----> 0:01:36
While the threat of famine looms with extreme scarcity of food, people are already starving.

25
0:01:36----> 0:01:40.040000
Parents and children are having to journey two hours at times just to get fresh water

26
0:01:40.040000----> 0:01:41.040000
to drink.

27
0:01:41.040000----> 0:01:43.840000
Half the population need humanitarian assistance.

28
0:01:43.840000----> 0:01:47.360000
All this is happening while Somalia still hasn't even fully recovered from the last

29
0:01:47.360000----> 0:01:53.040000
regional drought in 2017 or from the devastating effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

30
0:01:53.040000----> 0:01:58.080000
More for us now from CNN International correspondent, Larry Madowo.

31
0:01:58.080000----> 0:02:01.800000
This is what I'm hearing from every Somalia official I've spoken to and every aid worker

32
0:02:01.800000----> 0:02:02.800000
there.

33
0:02:02.800000----> 0:02:08.520000
This is one of the worst droughts they have ever seen and the effects are heartbreaking.

34
0:02:08.520000----> 0:02:13.040000
But will someone else happening in the world suffering Somalis can get forgotten?

35
0:02:13.040000----> 0:02:17.880000
Right now, about half of the population in Somalia need humanitarian assistance and

36
0:02:17.880000----> 0:02:19.160000
it could get worse.

37
0:02:19.160000----> 0:02:24.640000
The country has gone two years without drains and is experiencing its worst drought in 40

38
0:02:24.640000----> 0:02:25.640000
years.

39
0:02:25.640000----> 0:02:31.480000
Aid agencies say around 7 million Somalis are projected to face food insecurity.

40
0:02:31.480000----> 0:02:36.920000
Even animals struggle to survive, but it's not just supplies at home that are an issue.

41
0:02:36.920000----> 0:02:42.560000
The battle against the armed group Al Shabaab makes delivering aid hard.

42
0:02:42.560000----> 0:02:46
And the war in Ukraine has sent food prices soaring.

43
0:02:46----> 0:02:47.960000
But help is coming.

44
0:02:47.960000----> 0:02:56
More than 70% of the $1.4 billion in aid for Somalia has been raised mostly by the US.

45
0:02:56----> 0:03:02.640000
And just this month, Ukraine pledged 50,000 tons of wheat to both Somalia and Ethiopia,

46
0:03:02.640000----> 0:03:06.240000
much like this shipment which docked in Djibouti last month.

47
0:03:06.240000----> 0:03:11.360000
Somalia was already suffering from the impacts of the global pandemic, but adds to that the

48
0:03:11.360000----> 0:03:16.320000
effect of Russia's invasion of Ukraine on food supplies, but especially this severe

49
0:03:16.320000----> 0:03:19.200000
drought has brought the country to the brink.

50
0:03:19.200000----> 0:03:23.840000
The situation is so desperate that if nothing changes, more people could die.

51
0:03:23.840000----> 0:03:27.280000
That is why that funding they're looking for will be so critical.

52
0:03:27.280000----> 0:03:31.720000
Let me know in the comments below.

53
0:03:31.720000----> 0:03:33.040000
Ten second trivia.

54
0:03:33.040000----> 0:03:37.920000
In carpentry, what term means to cut a sloping angle that is not 90 degrees?

55
0:03:37.920000----> 0:03:44.800000
Inlay, Counterboard, Crosscut or Bevel.

56
0:03:44.800000----> 0:03:52.280000
If you said Bevel, put your hands up, you are alright.

57
0:03:52.280000----> 0:03:57.160000
We are thrilled now to introduce you to one of our CNN heroes, Nora Elkori Spencer.

58
0:03:57.160000----> 0:04:01.640000
She's closing the opportunity gap by training women for careers in construction and helping

59
0:04:01.640000----> 0:04:03.280000
them build new lives.

60
0:04:03.280000----> 0:04:08.360000
Her nonprofit, Hope Renovations, offers free programs preparing women with the skills and

61
0:04:08.360000----> 0:04:15.120000
certifications they need to find high paying jobs in construction.

62
0:04:15.120000----> 0:04:18.760000
I wasn't a handy person growing up.

63
0:04:18.760000----> 0:04:22.840000
If my parents needed something fixed, they would ask my brother and they just never asked

64
0:04:22.840000----> 0:04:23.840000
me.

65
0:04:23.840000----> 0:04:31.200000
When my husband, Brian, and I bought our first home, I realized pretty quickly that my tastes

66
0:04:31.200000----> 0:04:34.440000
were outside of my budget.

67
0:04:34.440000----> 0:04:40.960000
So I just started buying tools and trying to learn things on my own and I figured out

68
0:04:40.960000----> 0:04:44.400000
pretty quick that I was good at it.

69
0:04:44.400000----> 0:04:50.360000
Over the years, I had higher contractors to help me do things I didn't know how to do

70
0:04:50.360000----> 0:04:52.240000
and I actually learned a lot.

71
0:04:52.240000----> 0:04:57.600000
And then it hit me that I had never met another woman.

72
0:04:57.600000----> 0:05:02.320000
In my mid-thirties, I decided to go back to school and get a master's in social work.

73
0:05:02.320000----> 0:05:10.720000
I was doing a field placement in a homeless shelter working with women who needed a good

74
0:05:10.720000----> 0:05:13.600000
living wage paying opportunity.

75
0:05:13.600000----> 0:05:17.240000
And I would talk to them about jobs in this industry.

76
0:05:17.240000----> 0:05:21.760000
And their reaction was always no one's ever taught me any of that stuff.

77
0:05:21.760000----> 0:05:24.400000
It's a man's job.

78
0:05:24.400000----> 0:05:26.800000
And I realized there's an opportunity gap.

79
0:05:26.800000----> 0:05:27.800000
I can help fill.

80
0:05:27.800000----> 0:05:34
We're going to talk about roof framing and putting the sheathing on the roof today.

81
0:05:34----> 0:05:36.320000
So we're going to go ahead and plan that out.

82
0:05:36.320000----> 0:05:37.800000
I hope for innovations.

83
0:05:37.800000----> 0:05:41.680000
We offer a 10-week pre-apprenticeship program.

84
0:05:41.680000----> 0:05:46.680000
They learn safety, tools and materials, blueprint reading, construction math.

85
0:05:46.680000----> 0:05:48.120000
Have you got all that?

86
0:05:48.120000----> 0:05:49.120000
Yeah.

87
0:05:49.120000----> 0:05:50.120000
Got it.

88
0:05:50.120000----> 0:05:52.200000
Alright, so let's go put it into practice.

89
0:05:52.200000----> 0:05:54.720000
And then they get into hands-on practice with tools.

90
0:05:54.720000----> 0:05:59.160000
They learn the basics of carpentry, electrical, plumbing.

91
0:05:59.160000----> 0:06:00.640000
It's a lot of work.

92
0:06:00.640000----> 0:06:05.240000
We're going to figure out where our birch mails are going to go.

93
0:06:05.240000----> 0:06:07.240000
Our program is totally free.

94
0:06:07.240000----> 0:06:13.200000
We've had single moms, women in recovery, women who are just re-careering.

95
0:06:13.200000----> 0:06:18.520000
All kinds of different people have come in together and finding a shared excitement.

96
0:06:18.520000----> 0:06:21.600000
Our program is actually solving two problems at once.

97
0:06:21.600000----> 0:06:27.920000
We're bringing women into this industry and we're also helping older adults age and

98
0:06:27.920000----> 0:06:28.920000
place.

99
0:06:28.920000----> 0:06:35.120000
The crew is here today building a ramp for a client who, she's having trouble getting

100
0:06:35.120000----> 0:06:37.280000
into her home.

101
0:06:37.280000----> 0:06:45.040000
I've been here since 1975 and I have authorized this real bad in my knees.

102
0:06:45.040000----> 0:06:51.360000
It was very hard trying to get in and out because I didn't have anything to hold on

103
0:06:51.360000----> 0:06:52.360000
to.

104
0:06:52.360000----> 0:06:58.400000
We're able to bring the trainees out onto job sites with our construction team so they

105
0:06:58.400000----> 0:07:02.080000
can get their hands dirty, they can practice their newfound skills.

106
0:07:02.080000----> 0:07:03.880000
This is where it gets fun.

107
0:07:03.880000----> 0:07:07.400000
So they're giving back while they're learning.

108
0:07:07.400000----> 0:07:09.080000
That's really a win-win.

109
0:07:09.080000----> 0:07:15.040000
If we don't see women out there doing this, other women, they'll never see this as an

110
0:07:15.040000----> 0:07:16.040000
opportunity.

111
0:07:16.040000----> 0:07:19
So that's a big part of what we're trying to do here.

112
0:07:19----> 0:07:24.880000
And they just act like they have a fond doing.

113
0:07:24.880000----> 0:07:30.080000
I want to thank y'all for all your help and all your beautiful smiles.

114
0:07:30.080000----> 0:07:35.160000
I'm so grateful just to know that there's some people out here that cares and I want

115
0:07:35.160000----> 0:07:37.880000
to help forget all you women.

116
0:07:37.880000----> 0:07:39.600000
I'll tell anybody.

117
0:07:39.600000----> 0:07:41.080000
You want to see a ramp build?

118
0:07:41.080000----> 0:07:42.080000
Come to my house.

119
0:07:42.080000----> 0:07:43.280000
I'll tell you who build it.

120
0:07:43.280000----> 0:07:44.280000
Hi.

121
0:07:44.280000----> 0:07:48.360000
When you're out there and you get to watch something come together that you build.

122
0:07:48.360000----> 0:07:51.040000
That feels like it's going to work for you.

123
0:07:51.040000----> 0:07:52.040000
Yes.

124
0:07:52.040000----> 0:07:53.040000
Great.

125
0:07:53.040000----> 0:07:54.040000
This is awesome.

126
0:07:54.040000----> 0:07:57.240000
There's just such a feeling of accomplishment.

127
0:07:57.240000----> 0:08:02.760000
We're providing hope to the people that we serve.

128
0:08:02.760000----> 0:08:04.760000
That's a lot of lives changed.

129
0:08:04.760000----> 0:08:07.160000
I love that part of it.

130
0:08:07.160000----> 0:08:18.280000
We're helping them renovate their lives.

131
0:08:18.280000----> 0:08:22.320000
For today's 10 out of 10, we're taking you to the small town in Kentucky called Lake

132
0:08:22.320000----> 0:08:25.400000
Malone where something is a skew.

133
0:08:25.400000----> 0:08:29.920000
In the woods, you will find these creatures that mysteriously popped up sometime last

134
0:08:29.920000----> 0:08:31.080000
year.

135
0:08:31.080000----> 0:08:35.400000
Locals call these statues the big twigs and these things are big.

136
0:08:35.400000----> 0:08:38.800000
The tallest stands at a whopping 18 feet tall.

137
0:08:38.800000----> 0:08:43.040000
Three of them were first introduced to the area in 2021 and locals didn't even really

138
0:08:43.040000----> 0:08:44.680000
know where they came from.

139
0:08:44.680000----> 0:08:49.040000
But recently, three more have appeared and park officials say that these artists' creations

140
0:08:49.040000----> 0:08:53.080000
have increased park visitation tremendously.

141
0:08:53.080000----> 0:08:56.680000
Also tremendous, the Globe Academy in Atlanta, Georgia.

142
0:08:56.680000----> 0:08:58.040000
We see you.

143
0:08:58.040000----> 0:09:02.760000
And one more thing before we go, did you know that today is national do something nice day.

144
0:09:02.760000----> 0:09:07.040000
So whether it's a kind word or two or just a simple smile, do the little things that

145
0:09:07.040000----> 0:09:09.040000
make this world a better place.

146
0:09:09.040000----> 0:09:11.560000
I'm Coy Wire and this is CNN 10.
