OK, David, hi, I'm Susan, and it's great that we can get together and discuss, I think,

2
0:00:07.840000----> 0:00:12.400000
a really interesting topic, which is, is the internet bringing out the best in us?

3
0:00:12.400000----> 0:00:19.280000
My own view is that if people are spending a lot of time in this new place, this two-dimensional

4
0:00:19.280000----> 0:00:23.760000
world of just hearing and vision, for every hour they're doing that, that's not being

5
0:00:23.760000----> 0:00:27.480000
in the real world, not walking along a beach, giving someone a hug, looking someone in the

6
0:00:27.560000----> 0:00:32.120000
eye, and especially for young people who perhaps haven't rehearsed those skills, those interpersonal

7
0:00:32.120000----> 0:00:38.360000
skills, and had those three-dimensional experiences where actions have consequences, then they might

8
0:00:38.360000----> 0:00:42.680000
be missing out if they're doing this for long periods of time, and as a neuroscientist, I'm

9
0:00:42.680000----> 0:00:48.680000
very aware that the brain adapts to the environment, exquisitely evolved the human brain, to adapt

10
0:00:48.680000----> 0:00:53.720000
to any environment it's in, and so therefore, if you have an environment that is so different,

11
0:00:54.440000----> 0:00:59.720000
that perhaps people are existing in for substantial periods of their waking hours, and it's inevitable

12
0:00:59.720000----> 0:01:05.160000
the brain will change, and my concern is although there's many good things about the internet that

13
0:01:05.160000----> 0:01:10.680000
you can rehearse certain skills, but the same token, there's perhaps certain areas where you

14
0:01:10.680000----> 0:01:16.840000
might see problems with attention, with possible addiction, with how you use information, how that

15
0:01:16.840000----> 0:01:21.320000
relates to your memory, and above all, with how you relate to people and how you empathize with them.

16
0:01:21.480000----> 0:01:26.200000
It's early days, isn't it, and certainly at the kind of neurological level, there's a lot of

17
0:01:26.200000----> 0:01:34.360000
research still to be done, I guess my experience, say, using the organisation as a metaphor,

18
0:01:34.920000----> 0:01:41.160000
so with 38 degrees, we're a hyper-connected organisation that relies very heavily on the

19
0:01:41.160000----> 0:01:45.640000
internet to bring people together and make decisions, but we've at the same time recognised, but that's

20
0:01:45.720000----> 0:01:51.400000
no substitute for proper face-to-face content, and so alongside all the online consultations we do

21
0:01:51.400000----> 0:01:56.760000
with our membership, we also regularly organise curries with members in particular areas, because

22
0:01:56.760000----> 0:01:59.480000
we know that alongside having a conversation on face-to-face-

23
0:01:59.480000----> 0:02:05.560000
There's a value in sitting down with people and discussing things over beer and pop-a-dots,

24
0:02:05.560000----> 0:02:12.040000
maybe the thing we've learnt to do is to switch between modes in ways, and that seems to be

25
0:02:12.040000----> 0:02:16.280000
something that a lot of people are fairly able to adapt to. I mean, there aren't, with any new

26
0:02:16.280000----> 0:02:20.920000
technology, you can get some sort of anti-social tweeting on this. Of course, the big difference is

27
0:02:20.920000----> 0:02:25.160000
if these are people you know in real life anyway, and then you're communicating via Facebook, that's

28
0:02:25.160000----> 0:02:29.960000
just fine, that's great, that's just fine. When you've never met the people, and there, as I say,

29
0:02:29.960000----> 0:02:34.280000
they're an audience rather than friends, when they're people, you have several hundred of them,

30
0:02:34.280000----> 0:02:38.120000
and then the concern is the more time you spend doing that, especially for young people, you're

31
0:02:38.200000----> 0:02:42.840000
not rehearsing those face-to-face skills, you're not rehearsing empathy, you're not rehearsing

32
0:02:42.840000----> 0:02:48.280000
reading body language, you're not developing in-depth the kind of friendships that people

33
0:02:48.280000----> 0:02:52.280000
up until they have experience, simply because you don't have time. Some of the kind of types

34
0:02:52.280000----> 0:02:58.760000
of isolation which you're talking about, I think probably a product as much of economic forces

35
0:02:58.760000----> 0:03:05.400000
and social change over the last 30, 40 years, and I think what we're seeing is actually in some

36
0:03:05.400000----> 0:03:10.760000
ways that the internet is, at the same time as offering people virtual alternatives to face-to-face

37
0:03:10.760000----> 0:03:14.600000
context, it's actually offering people ways of connecting with people, meeting people who are

38
0:03:14.600000----> 0:03:18.040000
like-minded, and then meeting with real-worlders. Without us, without us, and I would love for

39
0:03:18.040000----> 0:03:23
example my widowed mum who's 85, going on 80, I would love her to be on Facebook, she refuses,

40
0:03:23----> 0:03:28.600000
for these very reasons, but I think the problem is how do we shape an environment or shape a

41
0:03:28.600000----> 0:03:33.640000
society where this will happen? I think it's an article of faith and I know it's nice to be optimistic,

42
0:03:33.720000----> 0:03:38.520000
I as a scientist, all scientists are optimistic, so I'm optimistic actually. How can we get there?

43
0:03:38.520000----> 0:03:44.200000
Because I think the trends are, especially with the teenagers, that that's not necessarily the case,

44
0:03:44.200000----> 0:03:50.680000
that they are, it's such a ready and tempting and non-challenging form of communication where

45
0:03:50.680000----> 0:03:56.280000
indeed you can not be accountable for what you say. It is very tempting and very exciting and you

46
0:03:56.280000----> 0:03:59
can communicate all over the world and you can tell what you like and people applaud you,

47
0:03:59----> 0:04:05.160000
you can have lots of followers, you can be cool. How can we help people see that this should be a

48
0:04:05.160000----> 0:04:09.800000
means to an end rather than an end in itself? In my sense is that it's quite hard right now

49
0:04:09.800000----> 0:04:13.080000
to say what the long-term impacts are of some of the things, because we only need to have very

50
0:04:13.080000----> 0:04:17.640000
short term. So we are in the realm of speculation, which is that- not quite. It's good to start the

51
0:04:17.640000----> 0:04:21
time. Indeed, it's good to start the time. I think given that we are dealing with the minds of the

52
0:04:21----> 0:04:25.640000
next generation, we can't really just sit around saying it's a long-term children study, let's give

53
0:04:25.720000----> 0:04:30.360000
it 10 years before we try and do anything we even think about. I guess what I'm saying is that the

54
0:04:30.360000----> 0:04:37.560000
extent to which you act on limited evidence depends on your assessment of risk. I guess my sense is

55
0:04:37.560000----> 0:04:43.560000
that the picture you're painting is quite a long way towards the pessimistic end of the spectrum.

56
0:04:44.120000----> 0:04:50.120000
Well, it depends on who you read. What I personally say is I don't give value judgments, but I do say

57
0:04:50.120000----> 0:04:54.760000
this is something too important to wait. If we look at the literature, if we look at the reports that

58
0:04:54.840000----> 0:04:57.960000
are coming out, if we look at surveys, if we look at the goods and services,

59
0:04:57.960000----> 0:05:02.120000
that are indicating a certain mindset of the consumer, then this is something we need to start

60
0:05:02.120000----> 0:05:03.160000
talking about right now.
