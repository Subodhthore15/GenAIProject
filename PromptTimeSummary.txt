""" 

1
0:00:00----> 0:00:10.440000
Hi everybody, on 24th of January 2023, the Hindenburg report came out with some serious

2
0:00:10.440000----> 0:00:13.580000
allegations about the market cap of the Adani group companies.

3
0:00:13.580000----> 0:00:15.600000
And then we all know what happened.

4
0:00:15.600000----> 0:00:18.340000
Adani Group

5
0:00:18.340000----> 0:00:22.120000
Last week's report from Hindenburg research that accused Adani of fraud and stock price

6
0:00:22.120000----> 0:00:23.120000
manipulation.

7
0:00:23.120000----> 0:00:26.480000
Adani Group companies continued to slide for a third straight session.

8
0:00:26.480000----> 0:00:31.240000
Adani Group says it's exploring legal action against the US short seller Hindenburg research.

9
0:00:31.240000----> 0:00:36
He says Hindenburg is making an attack not just on the company, he's also making an

10
0:00:36----> 0:00:39.280000
attack on India and its growth ambitions.

11
0:00:39.280000----> 0:00:45.120000
In just 10 days, the Adani Group lost $110 billion in value and Gautam Adani's fortune

12
0:00:45.120000----> 0:00:49.440000
went down from $121 billion to $61 billion.

13
0:00:49.440000----> 0:00:52.520000
And the stock market of India was in complete chaos.

14
0:00:52.520000----> 0:00:56.440000
But you know what, in the next one year something magical happened and Gautam Adani's total

15
0:00:56.440000----> 0:01:02.960000
wealth went from $37.7 billion a year back to $100 billion again.

16
0:01:02.960000----> 0:01:07.240000
And while most people think that the Hindenburg report harmed the Adani Group companies, when

17
0:01:07.240000----> 0:01:12.480000
we looked deeper, we realized that this short selling was perhaps a great thing for the

18
0:01:12.480000----> 0:01:13.480000
Adani's.

19
0:01:13.480000----> 0:01:21.360000
Because today, their cash balance is the highest ever at $45,895, which is $5.5 billion.

20
0:01:21.360000----> 0:01:27.680000
And above that, if you look at their 5 year EBITDA, it was just growing at a CAGR of 26.3%.

21
0:01:27.680000----> 0:01:34.440000
But now their portfolio level EBITDA has jumped by 47% year on year in the first half of 2024.

22
0:01:34.440000----> 0:01:38.120000
And this is their highest ever half year growth in history.

23
0:01:38.120000----> 0:01:42.840000
The question is, what exactly changed so drastically after the Hindenburg episode that the Adani

24
0:01:42.840000----> 0:01:47.120000
stocks have started rising again, what was their business strategy to win the test of

25
0:01:47.120000----> 0:01:48.420000
their shareholders.

26
0:01:48.420000----> 0:01:51.540000
And lastly, what are the business lessons that we need to learn from the incredible

27
0:01:51.540000----> 0:02:00.180000
comeback of the Adani Group?

28
0:02:00.180000----> 0:02:04.460000
This is a story that dates back to 2020 when Adani's exponential growth story began.

29
0:02:04.460000----> 0:02:08.660000
So if you see this chart, Gautam Adani's net worth reached a peak after Covid to go

30
0:02:08.660000----> 0:02:14.660000
from $19 billion in 2019 to more than $120 billion in 2022.

31
0:02:14.660000----> 0:02:19.740000
And between 2020 to 2023, as you can see in this table, the stock price of their company

32
0:02:19.740000----> 0:02:21.380000
shot up exponentially.

33
0:02:21.380000----> 0:02:27.420000
In fact, the lowest performing stock in their portfolio also appreciated by 98% in these

34
0:02:27.420000----> 0:02:28.660000
three years.

35
0:02:28.660000----> 0:02:32.300000
This was because the Adani's were breaking record after record.

36
0:02:32.300000----> 0:02:37.460000
For example, the Adani ports and SCC became the biggest private port operator in the country

37
0:02:37.460000----> 0:02:40.500000
with a 94% market share in private ports.

38
0:02:40.500000----> 0:02:45.060000
Similarly, Adani Enterprises holds the title of India's largest cool trader.

39
0:02:45.060000----> 0:02:48.820000
Adani Green Energy is one of the largest solar developers in the world.

40
0:02:48.820000----> 0:02:53.420000
Adani Total Gas operates the largest city gas distribution business in India and Adani

41
0:02:53.420000----> 0:02:57.980000
Power is the largest private thermal power producer in India.

42
0:02:57.980000----> 0:03:01.780000
This is when both national and international press were fascinated by the growth of the

43
0:03:01.780000----> 0:03:02.940000
Adanes.

44
0:03:02.940000----> 0:03:06.780000
And just when everything was going well, the Hindenburg report came out.

45
0:03:06.780000----> 0:03:12.620000
Hindenburg report, they claim that Adani is accused of stock price manipulation using

46
0:03:12.620000----> 0:03:17.340000
shell companies that are then using their money to pump up the stock of Adani Enterprises.

47
0:03:17.340000----> 0:03:20.820000
So it's a wide-ranging report that really raises some big concerns about who is many

48
0:03:20.820000----> 0:03:23.500000
times seen as the biggest, most powerful name in India.

49
0:03:23.500000----> 0:03:26.140000
The Adani group shares are in a free fold.

50
0:03:26.140000----> 0:03:28.820000
Adani Group stocks, they are falling in trade today.

51
0:03:28.820000----> 0:03:32.420000
After Reuters highlights details from a Hindenburg research report.

52
0:03:32.420000----> 0:03:36.420000
But the question we hear is, in spite of such a big setback, how did the Adanes come back

53
0:03:36.420000----> 0:03:39.860000
on track and what exactly was their business strategy?

54
0:03:39.860000----> 0:03:44.060000
Well to understand this comeback strategy, we must understand the allegations that Hindenburg

55
0:03:44.060000----> 0:03:45.060000
made.

56
0:03:45.060000----> 0:03:48.140000
So let's quickly understand these allegations and then the Adani strategy.

57
0:03:48.140000----> 0:03:52.420000
The first allegation was that the Adani group has used share pledging to take loans from

58
0:03:52.420000----> 0:03:53.720000
the banks.

59
0:03:53.720000----> 0:03:58.380000
And the Hindenburg report pointed out that the method of share pledging could be very risky.

60
0:03:58.380000----> 0:04:01.380000
Now if you know why it is risky, please skip to this time stamp.

61
0:04:01.380000----> 0:04:04.180000
If not, here's a very simple explanation of the same.

62
0:04:04.180000----> 0:04:07.700000
Let's say there is a company called ThinkTech which has 100 million shares floating with

63
0:04:07.700000----> 0:04:11.020000
60 million shares owned by Shreya who is the promoter.

64
0:04:11.020000----> 0:04:13.860000
And let's say the share price of ThinkTech is 500 rupees.

65
0:04:13.860000----> 0:04:19.820000
So Shreya's 60 million shares are worth 60 million into 500 equal to 30 billion rupees

66
0:04:19.820000----> 0:04:22.580000
or 3000 crores.

67
0:04:22.580000----> 0:04:27.420000
So if Shreya wants to raise money for expansion, she can either take up loans, issue bonds

68
0:04:27.420000----> 0:04:30.100000
or she could dilute her equity.

69
0:04:30.100000----> 0:04:33.660000
But here's where, using share pledging, she could keep her 3 million shares with the

70
0:04:33.660000----> 0:04:35.620000
bank and take out a loan.

71
0:04:35.620000----> 0:04:40.860000
So 3 million shares of ThinkTech are worth 150 crores and by keeping these shares as collateral

72
0:04:40.860000----> 0:04:44.860000
with the bank, she can take out a 100 crore rupee loan.

73
0:04:44.860000----> 0:04:49.180000
So if she can't pay back her loan amount, the bank can sell Shreya share and recover

74
0:04:49.180000----> 0:04:50.180000
its loan amount.

75
0:04:50.180000----> 0:04:54.580000
Now the reason why this method is risky is because, tomorrow, suddenly if ThinkTech's

76
0:04:54.580000----> 0:05:00.060000
stock crashes from 500 to 100 rupees, the 3 million shares that Shreya kept cool.

77
0:05:00.060000----> 0:05:08.500000
So even if the bank sells these shares, the bank cannot recover the money that was

78
0:05:08.500000----> 0:05:09.580000
lent to Shreya.

79
0:05:09.580000----> 0:05:10.820000
This is how share pledging works.

80
0:05:10.820000----> 0:05:15.020000
Now remember this example because we will use it later in the episode.

81
0:05:15.020000----> 0:05:19.340000
So what the Hindenburg report said was that, the Adani group was listing their companies

82
0:05:19.340000----> 0:05:21.500000
and pledging shares to get loans.

83
0:05:21.500000----> 0:05:25.540000
And then they were passing these loans onto other group companies for investing in new

84
0:05:25.540000----> 0:05:26.540000
projects.

85
0:05:26.540000----> 0:05:27.540000
So was it risky?

86
0:05:27.540000----> 0:05:28.540000
Absolutely yes.

87
0:05:28.540000----> 0:05:29.540000
But was it wrong?

88
0:05:29.540000----> 0:05:32.180000
Well, because risky doesn't mean wrong, right?

89
0:05:32.180000----> 0:05:35.500000
Secondly, the report also pointed out the current ratio of an adani group.

90
0:05:35.500000----> 0:05:39.180000
For those who don't know, the current ratio is a financial ratio that measures the company's

91
0:05:39.180000----> 0:05:41.940000
ability to pay its short term obligations.

92
0:05:41.940000----> 0:05:46.060000
And it is calculated by dividing a company's current assets by its current liabilities.

93
0:05:46.060000----> 0:05:49.300000
And again, if you understand current ratio, please skip to this time's time.

94
0:05:49.300000----> 0:05:52.540000
But if you don't, here's again a very quick explanation.

95
0:05:52.540000----> 0:05:57.220000
Current assets are the assets that the company can immediately sell and generate cash.

96
0:05:57.220000----> 0:05:59.700000
And by immediate, I mean in less than one year.

97
0:05:59.700000----> 0:06:03.580000
This would include the cash, receivable amounts, inventory, etc.

98
0:06:03.580000----> 0:06:08.460000
And current liabilities are nothing but the amount of money that we are due to pay in

99
0:06:08.460000----> 0:06:09.900000
the next one year.

100
0:06:09.900000----> 0:06:13.700000
So for any company, if current assets are worth 50 crores and the current liabilities

101
0:06:13.700000----> 0:06:18.820000
are worth 25 crores, the current ratio would be 50 crores divided by 25 crores, which is

102
0:06:18.820000----> 0:06:19.820000
2.

103
0:06:19.820000----> 0:06:25.020000
So this means the company has twice the money it would need for the next one year.

104
0:06:25.020000----> 0:06:27.700000
So if this ratio is below 1, it's a negative sign.

105
0:06:27.700000----> 0:06:30.100000
If this ratio is equal to 1, it is normal.

106
0:06:30.100000----> 0:06:33.500000
And if it is above 1, it is absolutely fantastic.

107
0:06:33.500000----> 0:06:38.180000
And the Hindid-Mugribboud pointed out that 5 out of the 7 group companies of the Adani

108
0:06:38.180000----> 0:06:41.380000
had a current ratio of below 1, which was risky.

109
0:06:41.380000----> 0:06:45.740000
And apart from these 2 major allegations, there were several other allegations like the Adani

110
0:06:45.740000----> 0:06:48.140000
group owning shell companies in tax events.

111
0:06:48.140000----> 0:06:51.660000
And all of these allegations have very easily been addressed in a special episode that we

112
0:06:51.660000----> 0:06:52.860000
made about a year back.

113
0:06:52.860000----> 0:06:55.780000
And you may refer to that episode from this i button.

114
0:06:55.780000----> 0:06:59.780000
If this is very clear to you, let's look at how the Adani's made a comeback.

115
0:06:59.780000----> 0:07:00.940000
Let's talk business now.

116
0:07:00.940000----> 0:07:06.060000
Adani group stocks run it to cup their best day since a scathing report by Hindid-Mug

117
0:07:06.060000----> 0:07:07.060000
research.

118
0:07:07.060000----> 0:07:10.660000
All the 10 Adani stocks are up into the green.

119
0:07:10.660000----> 0:07:15.220000
Some are up by even up to 20% on an intraday trading basis.

120
0:07:15.220000----> 0:07:18.140000
Adani Enterprises for instance is up 7%.

121
0:07:18.140000----> 0:07:21.900000
Adani Energy and Adani Transmission are up nearly 12% each.

122
0:07:21.900000----> 0:07:25.100000
Adani Total Gas is also up nearly 15% now.

123
0:07:25.100000----> 0:07:29.500000
Now this is absolutely stunning to me as a student of business because if you look at

124
0:07:29.500000----> 0:07:34.100000
the Adani group, something increases happen to all their numbers in the last one year.

125
0:07:34.100000----> 0:07:38.900000
The current ratios of most of the Adani group companies have improved in the last 9 months.

126
0:07:38.900000----> 0:07:42.580000
And several big investors have already invested in the company which shows their confidence

127
0:07:42.580000----> 0:07:43.820000
in the Adani group.

128
0:07:43.820000----> 0:07:48.540000
And suddenly the same stocks that crashed are now rising up again.

129
0:07:48.540000----> 0:07:51.180000
So the question over here is how exactly did this happen?

130
0:07:51.180000----> 0:07:55.380000
Well, the first and foremost thing that the Adani's did was deleveraging and there are

131
0:07:55.380000----> 0:07:56.700000
two things to deleverage.

132
0:07:56.700000----> 0:08:01.220000
Firstly, as the shares started tanking, there was a possibility of the Adani's entering

133
0:08:01.220000----> 0:08:02.940000
into a vicious cycle.

134
0:08:02.940000----> 0:08:05.020000
Now listen to this very carefully.

135
0:08:05.020000----> 0:08:09.420000
When a company pledges its shares to get a loan, the share price decreases and the company

136
0:08:09.420000----> 0:08:11.740000
gets something called a margin call.

137
0:08:11.740000----> 0:08:15.100000
Now again, this is a very simple concept that you need to know before you want.

138
0:08:15.100000----> 0:08:19.340000
So let's understand margin call using a very simple example.

139
0:08:19.340000----> 0:08:23.860000
So in our previous example, Shreya pledged 150 crores worth of shares to get a loan of

140
0:08:23.860000----> 0:08:25.620000
100 crores.

141
0:08:25.620000----> 0:08:31.220000
Now when the stock price is tanked by 80%, this collateral was worth only 30 crores.

142
0:08:31.220000----> 0:08:33.340000
But how much collateral did the bank need?

143
0:08:33.340000----> 0:08:36.660000
They needed collateral worth 150 crores.

144
0:08:36.660000----> 0:08:38.100000
So what will the bank do?

145
0:08:38.100000----> 0:08:43.140000
The bank will ask Shreya to pledge more shares so that the total worth of the collateral

146
0:08:43.140000----> 0:08:45.220000
could be 150 crores.

147
0:08:45.220000----> 0:08:51.260000
And since ThinkTech's share price has dropped from 500 rupees to 100 rupees, now Shreya has

148
0:08:51.260000----> 0:08:57.180000
to pledge another 12 million shares which are worth 120 crores so that her collateral

149
0:08:57.180000----> 0:09:04.060000
of 30 crores will have another 120 crores added to make the collateral worth 150 crores.

150
0:09:04.060000----> 0:09:06.340000
This is called as margin call.
