0:00:00----> 0:00:10.440000
Hi everybody, on 24th of January 2023, the Hindenburg report came out with some serious

2
0:00:10.440000----> 0:00:13.580000
allegations about the market cap of the Adani group companies.

3
0:00:13.580000----> 0:00:15.600000
And then we all know what happened.

4
0:00:15.600000----> 0:00:18.340000
Adani Group

5
0:00:18.340000----> 0:00:22.120000
Last week's report from Hindenburg research that accused Adani of fraud and stock price

6
0:00:22.120000----> 0:00:23.120000
manipulation.

7
0:00:23.120000----> 0:00:26.480000
Adani Group companies continued to slide for a third straight session.

8
0:00:26.480000----> 0:00:31.240000
Adani Group says it's exploring legal action against the US short seller Hindenburg research.

9
0:00:31.240000----> 0:00:36
He says Hindenburg is making an attack not just on the company, he's also making an

10
0:00:36----> 0:00:39.280000
attack on India and its growth ambitions.

11
0:00:39.280000----> 0:00:45.120000
In just 10 days, the Adani Group lost $110 billion in value and Gautam Adani's fortune

12
0:00:45.120000----> 0:00:49.440000
went down from $121 billion to $61 billion.

13
0:00:49.440000----> 0:00:52.520000
And the stock market of India was in complete chaos.

14
0:00:52.520000----> 0:00:56.440000
But you know what, in the next one year something magical happened and Gautam Adani's total

15
0:00:56.440000----> 0:01:02.960000
wealth went from $37.7 billion a year back to $100 billion again.

16
0:01:02.960000----> 0:01:07.240000
And while most people think that the Hindenburg report harmed the Adani Group companies, when

17
0:01:07.240000----> 0:01:12.480000
we looked deeper, we realized that this short selling was perhaps a great thing for the

18
0:01:12.480000----> 0:01:13.480000
Adani's.

19
0:01:13.480000----> 0:01:21.360000
Because today, their cash balance is the highest ever at $45,895, which is $5.5 billion.

20
0:01:21.360000----> 0:01:27.680000
And above that, if you look at their 5 year EBITDA, it was just growing at a CAGR of 26.3%.

21
0:01:27.680000----> 0:01:34.440000
But now their portfolio level EBITDA has jumped by 47% year on year in the first half of 2024.

22
0:01:34.440000----> 0:01:38.120000
And this is their highest ever half year growth in history.

23
0:01:38.120000----> 0:01:42.840000
The question is, what exactly changed so drastically after the Hindenburg episode that the Adani

24
0:01:42.840000----> 0:01:47.120000
stocks have started rising again, what was their business strategy to win the test of

25
0:01:47.120000----> 0:01:48.420000
their shareholders.

26
0:01:48.420000----> 0:01:51.540000
And lastly, what are the business lessons that we need to learn from the incredible

27
0:01:51.540000----> 0:02:00.180000
comeback of the Adani Group?

28
0:02:00.180000----> 0:02:04.460000
This is a story that dates back to 2020 when Adani's exponential growth story began.

29
0:02:04.460000----> 0:02:08.660000
So if you see this chart, Gautam Adani's net worth reached a peak after Covid to go

30
0:02:08.660000----> 0:02:14.660000
from $19 billion in 2019 to more than $120 billion in 2022.

31
0:02:14.660000----> 0:02:19.740000
And between 2020 to 2023, as you can see in this table, the stock price of their company

32
0:02:19.740000----> 0:02:21.380000
shot up exponentially.

33
0:02:21.380000----> 0:02:27.420000
In fact, the lowest performing stock in their portfolio also appreciated by 98% in these

34
0:02:27.420000----> 0:02:28.660000
three years.

35
0:02:28.660000----> 0:02:32.300000
This was because the Adani's were breaking record after record.

36
0:02:32.300000----> 0:02:37.460000
For example, the Adani ports and SCC became the biggest private port operator in the country

37
0:02:37.460000----> 0:02:40.500000
with a 94% market share in private ports.

38
0:02:40.500000----> 0:02:45.060000
Similarly, Adani Enterprises holds the title of India's largest cool trader.

39
0:02:45.060000----> 0:02:48.820000
Adani Green Energy is one of the largest solar developers in the world.

40
0:02:48.820000----> 0:02:53.420000
Adani Total Gas operates the largest city gas distribution business in India and Adani

41
0:02:53.420000----> 0:02:57.980000
Power is the largest private thermal power producer in India.

42
0:02:57.980000----> 0:03:01.780000
This is when both national and international press were fascinated by the growth of the

43
0:03:01.780000----> 0:03:02.940000
Adanes.

44
0:03:02.940000----> 0:03:06.780000
And just when everything was going well, the Hindenburg report came out.

45
0:03:06.780000----> 0:03:12.620000
Hindenburg report, they claim that Adani is accused of stock price manipulation using

46
0:03:12.620000----> 0:03:17.340000
shell companies that are then using their money to pump up the stock of Adani Enterprises.

47
0:03:17.340000----> 0:03:20.820000
So it's a wide-ranging report that really raises some big concerns about who is many

48
0:03:20.820000----> 0:03:23.500000
times seen as the biggest, most powerful name in India.

49
0:03:23.500000----> 0:03:26.140000
The Adani group shares are in a free fold.

50
0:03:26.140000----> 0:03:28.820000
Adani Group stocks, they are falling in trade today.

51
0:03:28.820000----> 0:03:32.420000
After Reuters highlights details from a Hindenburg research report.

52
0:03:32.420000----> 0:03:36.420000
But the question we hear is, in spite of such a big setback, how did the Adanes come back

53
0:03:36.420000----> 0:03:39.860000
on track and what exactly was their business strategy?

54
0:03:39.860000----> 0:03:44.060000
Well to understand this comeback strategy, we must understand the allegations that Hindenburg

55
0:03:44.060000----> 0:03:45.060000
made.

56
0:03:45.060000----> 0:03:48.140000
So let's quickly understand these allegations and then the Adani strategy.

57
0:03:48.140000----> 0:03:52.420000
The first allegation was that the Adani group has used share pledging to take loans from

58
0:03:52.420000----> 0:03:53.720000
the banks.

59
0:03:53.720000----> 0:03:58.380000
And the Hindenburg report pointed out that the method of share pledging could be very risky.

60
0:03:58.380000----> 0:04:01.380000
Now if you know why it is risky, please skip to this time stamp.

61
0:04:01.380000----> 0:04:04.180000
If not, here's a very simple explanation of the same.

62
0:04:04.180000----> 0:04:07.700000
Let's say there is a company called ThinkTech which has 100 million shares floating with

63
0:04:07.700000----> 0:04:11.020000
60 million shares owned by Shreya who is the promoter.

64
0:04:11.020000----> 0:04:13.860000
And let's say the share price of ThinkTech is 500 rupees.

65
0:04:13.860000----> 0:04:19.820000
So Shreya's 60 million shares are worth 60 million into 500 equal to 30 billion rupees

66
0:04:19.820000----> 0:04:22.580000
or 3000 crores.

67
0:04:22.580000----> 0:04:27.420000
So if Shreya wants to raise money for expansion, she can either take up loans, issue bonds

68
0:04:27.420000----> 0:04:30.100000
or she could dilute her equity.

69
0:04:30.100000----> 0:04:33.660000
But here's where, using share pledging, she could keep her 3 million shares with the

70
0:04:33.660000----> 0:04:35.620000
bank and take out a loan.

71
0:04:35.620000----> 0:04:40.860000
So 3 million shares of ThinkTech are worth 150 crores and by keeping these shares as collateral

72
0:04:40.860000----> 0:04:44.860000
with the bank, she can take out a 100 crore rupee loan.

73
0:04:44.860000----> 0:04:49.180000
So if she can't pay back her loan amount, the bank can sell Shreya share and recover

74
0:04:49.180000----> 0:04:50.180000
its loan amount.

75
0:04:50.180000----> 0:04:54.580000
Now the reason why this method is risky is because, tomorrow, suddenly if ThinkTech's

76
0:04:54.580000----> 0:05:00.060000
stock crashes from 500 to 100 rupees, the 3 million shares that Shreya kept cool.

77
0:05:00.060000----> 0:05:08.500000
So even if the bank sells these shares, the bank cannot recover the money that was

78
0:05:08.500000----> 0:05:09.580000
lent to Shreya.

79
0:05:09.580000----> 0:05:10.820000
This is how share pledging works.

80
0:05:10.820000----> 0:05:15.020000
Now remember this example because we will use it later in the episode.

81
0:05:15.020000----> 0:05:19.340000
So what the Hindenburg report said was that, the Adani group was listing their companies

82
0:05:19.340000----> 0:05:21.500000
and pledging shares to get loans.

83
0:05:21.500000----> 0:05:25.540000
And then they were passing these loans onto other group companies for investing in new

84
0:05:25.540000----> 0:05:26.540000
projects.

85
0:05:26.540000----> 0:05:27.540000
So was it risky?

86
0:05:27.540000----> 0:05:28.540000
Absolutely yes.

87
0:05:28.540000----> 0:05:29.540000
But was it wrong?

88
0:05:29.540000----> 0:05:32.180000
Well, because risky doesn't mean wrong, right?

89
0:05:32.180000----> 0:05:35.500000
Secondly, the report also pointed out the current ratio of an adani group.

90
0:05:35.500000----> 0:05:39.180000
For those who don't know, the current ratio is a financial ratio that measures the company's

91
0:05:39.180000----> 0:05:41.940000
ability to pay its short term obligations.

92
0:05:41.940000----> 0:05:46.060000
And it is calculated by dividing a company's current assets by its current liabilities.

93
0:05:46.060000----> 0:05:49.300000
And again, if you understand current ratio, please skip to this time's time.

94
0:05:49.300000----> 0:05:52.540000
But if you don't, here's again a very quick explanation.

95
0:05:52.540000----> 0:05:57.220000
Current assets are the assets that the company can immediately sell and generate cash.

96
0:05:57.220000----> 0:05:59.700000
And by immediate, I mean in less than one year.

97
0:05:59.700000----> 0:06:03.580000
This would include the cash, receivable amounts, inventory, etc.

98
0:06:03.580000----> 0:06:08.460000
And current liabilities are nothing but the amount of money that we are due to pay in

99
0:06:08.460000----> 0:06:09.900000
the next one year.

100
0:06:09.900000----> 0:06:13.700000
So for any company, if current assets are worth 50 crores and the current liabilities

101
0:06:13.700000----> 0:06:18.820000
are worth 25 crores, the current ratio would be 50 crores divided by 25 crores, which is

102
0:06:18.820000----> 0:06:19.820000
2.

103
0:06:19.820000----> 0:06:25.020000
So this means the company has twice the money it would need for the next one year.

104
0:06:25.020000----> 0:06:27.700000
So if this ratio is below 1, it's a negative sign.

105
0:06:27.700000----> 0:06:30.100000
If this ratio is equal to 1, it is normal.

106
0:06:30.100000----> 0:06:33.500000
And if it is above 1, it is absolutely fantastic.

107
0:06:33.500000----> 0:06:38.180000
And the Hindid-Mugribboud pointed out that 5 out of the 7 group companies of the Adani

108
0:06:38.180000----> 0:06:41.380000
had a current ratio of below 1, which was risky.

109
0:06:41.380000----> 0:06:45.740000
And apart from these 2 major allegations, there were several other allegations like the Adani

110
0:06:45.740000----> 0:06:48.140000
group owning shell companies in tax events.

111
0:06:48.140000----> 0:06:51.660000
And all of these allegations have very easily been addressed in a special episode that we

112
0:06:51.660000----> 0:06:52.860000
made about a year back.

113
0:06:52.860000----> 0:06:55.780000
And you may refer to that episode from this i button.

114
0:06:55.780000----> 0:06:59.780000
If this is very clear to you, let's look at how the Adani's made a comeback.

115
0:06:59.780000----> 0:07:00.940000
Let's talk business now.

116
0:07:00.940000----> 0:07:06.060000
Adani group stocks run it to cup their best day since a scathing report by Hindid-Mug

117
0:07:06.060000----> 0:07:07.060000
research.

118
0:07:07.060000----> 0:07:10.660000
All the 10 Adani stocks are up into the green.

119
0:07:10.660000----> 0:07:15.220000
Some are up by even up to 20% on an intraday trading basis.

120
0:07:15.220000----> 0:07:18.140000
Adani Enterprises for instance is up 7%.

121
0:07:18.140000----> 0:07:21.900000
Adani Energy and Adani Transmission are up nearly 12% each.

122
0:07:21.900000----> 0:07:25.100000
Adani Total Gas is also up nearly 15% now.

123
0:07:25.100000----> 0:07:29.500000
Now this is absolutely stunning to me as a student of business because if you look at

124
0:07:29.500000----> 0:07:34.100000
the Adani group, something increases happen to all their numbers in the last one year.

125
0:07:34.100000----> 0:07:38.900000
The current ratios of most of the Adani group companies have improved in the last 9 months.

126
0:07:38.900000----> 0:07:42.580000
And several big investors have already invested in the company which shows their confidence

127
0:07:42.580000----> 0:07:43.820000
in the Adani group.

128
0:07:43.820000----> 0:07:48.540000
And suddenly the same stocks that crashed are now rising up again.

129
0:07:48.540000----> 0:07:51.180000
So the question over here is how exactly did this happen?

130
0:07:51.180000----> 0:07:55.380000
Well, the first and foremost thing that the Adani's did was deleveraging and there are

131
0:07:55.380000----> 0:07:56.700000
two things to deleverage.

132
0:07:56.700000----> 0:08:01.220000
Firstly, as the shares started tanking, there was a possibility of the Adani's entering

133
0:08:01.220000----> 0:08:02.940000
into a vicious cycle.

134
0:08:02.940000----> 0:08:05.020000
Now listen to this very carefully.

135
0:08:05.020000----> 0:08:09.420000
When a company pledges its shares to get a loan, the share price decreases and the company

136
0:08:09.420000----> 0:08:11.740000
gets something called a margin call.

137
0:08:11.740000----> 0:08:15.100000
Now again, this is a very simple concept that you need to know before you want.

138
0:08:15.100000----> 0:08:19.340000
So let's understand margin call using a very simple example.

139
0:08:19.340000----> 0:08:23.860000
So in our previous example, Shreya pledged 150 crores worth of shares to get a loan of

140
0:08:23.860000----> 0:08:25.620000
100 crores.

141
0:08:25.620000----> 0:08:31.220000
Now when the stock price is tanked by 80%, this collateral was worth only 30 crores.

142
0:08:31.220000----> 0:08:33.340000
But how much collateral did the bank need?

143
0:08:33.340000----> 0:08:36.660000
They needed collateral worth 150 crores.

144
0:08:36.660000----> 0:08:38.100000
So what will the bank do?

145
0:08:38.100000----> 0:08:43.140000
The bank will ask Shreya to pledge more shares so that the total worth of the collateral

146
0:08:43.140000----> 0:08:45.220000
could be 150 crores.

147
0:08:45.220000----> 0:08:51.260000
And since ThinkTech's share price has dropped from 500 rupees to 100 rupees, now Shreya has

148
0:08:51.260000----> 0:08:57.180000
to pledge another 12 million shares which are worth 120 crores so that her collateral

149
0:08:57.180000----> 0:09:04.060000
of 30 crores will have another 120 crores added to make the collateral worth 150 crores.

150
0:09:04.060000----> 0:09:06.340000
This is called as margin call.

151
0:09:06.340000----> 0:09:10.620000
So now if the investors see a margin call what will happen, they will see margin call

152
0:09:10.620000----> 0:09:12.020000
as a negative sign.

153
0:09:12.020000----> 0:09:16.180000
Because now the company has to pledge more shares as collateral for the same amount of

154
0:09:16.180000----> 0:09:17.180000
debt.

155
0:09:17.180000----> 0:09:19.940000
And that means the company's credibility has gone down.

156
0:09:19.940000----> 0:09:21.300000
And eventually what will happen?

157
0:09:21.300000----> 0:09:24.420000
The investors will get frightened and they will start selling the shares.

158
0:09:24.420000----> 0:09:27.620000
Eventually the share price will also go down.

159
0:09:27.620000----> 0:09:31.340000
This will again trigger investors and they will start pulling their money out of the company

160
0:09:31.340000----> 0:09:32.700000
by selling their shares.

161
0:09:32.700000----> 0:09:37.340000
This selling will again decrease the price of ThinkTech's share so again Shreya will

162
0:09:37.340000----> 0:09:41.460000
get a margin call because of which she will have to pledge more shares.

163
0:09:41.460000----> 0:09:46.980000
So do you see this is a vicious cycle where promoters pledge shares as collateral if a

164
0:09:46.980000----> 0:09:52.260000
bad event happens share prices tank and then promoters get a margin call.

165
0:09:52.260000----> 0:09:57.020000
Then this margin call triggers the investors even more because it creates a panic.

166
0:09:57.020000----> 0:10:02.340000
This panic pushes them to start selling their shares and then the price is tank further.

167
0:10:02.340000----> 0:10:05.380000
And eventually the vicious cycle continues.

168
0:10:05.380000----> 0:10:10.900000
But you know what guys in case of the Adanes before the cycle could even start they very

169
0:10:10.900000----> 0:10:16.340000
smartly pulled themselves out of this vicious cycle and instead created a virtuous cycle

170
0:10:16.340000----> 0:10:17.380000
for themselves.

171
0:10:17.380000----> 0:10:21.220000
So when the report came out there were talks that Adanes would get a margin call from the

172
0:10:21.220000----> 0:10:24.100000
bank because their share prices had gone down.

173
0:10:24.100000----> 0:10:29.020000
But before they could get the margin call the Adanes paid back a large portion of their

174
0:10:29.020000----> 0:10:33.900000
debt by March 12th which they took by pledging their shares of Adanes ports, Adanes green

175
0:10:33.900000----> 0:10:36.060000
energy and Adanes transmission.

176
0:10:36.060000----> 0:10:37.900000
And this was done before the schedule date.

177
0:10:37.900000----> 0:10:39.780000
An update on the Adanes group now.

178
0:10:39.780000----> 0:10:44.700000
They have prepaid 2.15 billion dollars worth of share back financing ahead of a deadline.

179
0:10:44.700000----> 0:10:49.540000
A 500 million dollar loan taken for the acquisition of Ubuja Simmons was also paid back ahead

180
0:10:49.540000----> 0:10:50.540000
of time.

181
0:10:50.540000----> 0:10:56.820000
They have already prepaid or repaid almost all loans which is backed by shares.

182
0:10:56.820000----> 0:10:58.540000
So you know what happened?

183
0:10:58.540000----> 0:11:01.860000
It off a vicious cycle a virtuous cycle was created.

184
0:11:01.860000----> 0:11:02.860000
How?

185
0:11:02.860000----> 0:11:07.020000
Since the Adanes paid back their debt and unplaced their shares they didn't get the margin

186
0:11:07.020000----> 0:11:08.020000
call.

187
0:11:08.020000----> 0:11:11.740000
And the moment the headlines of Adanes payment hit the market the investors confidence was

188
0:11:11.740000----> 0:11:12.740000
retained.

189
0:11:12.740000----> 0:11:16.180000
So they invested even more money and the share price started increasing.

190
0:11:16.180000----> 0:11:20.180000
This led to even more investors investing in the company which meant more money to invest

191
0:11:20.180000----> 0:11:21.740000
in business.

192
0:11:21.740000----> 0:11:25.820000
This is how the Adanes turned a vicious cycle into a virtuous cycle.

193
0:11:25.820000----> 0:11:31.260000
And to add to that the Adanes called off their FBO of 20,000 crores after the completion

194
0:11:31.260000----> 0:11:33.140000
of the FBO process.

195
0:11:33.140000----> 0:11:37.700000
And they returned all of investors money even after getting a full substitution.

196
0:11:37.700000----> 0:11:42.900000
So this showed the investors that the group is standing in union with the investors.

197
0:11:42.900000----> 0:11:47.380000
Now to further regain the confidence of the investors the Adanes bought in some of the

198
0:11:47.380000----> 0:11:51.140000
most valuable players in the world to invest in their company.

199
0:11:51.140000----> 0:11:54.620000
So in the last 12 months you must have seen that the Adanes group started selling their

200
0:11:54.620000----> 0:11:56.340000
equity to multiple entities.

201
0:11:56.340000----> 0:12:02.220000
For example GUG completed a 15,000 446 crore investment in a portfolio of Adani companies.

202
0:12:02.220000----> 0:12:06.780000
And these investments were made across Adani ports and SZ, Adani green energy limited,

203
0:12:06.780000----> 0:12:10.180000
Adani transmission limited and Adani enterprise is limited.

204
0:12:10.180000----> 0:12:15.820000
Secondly, they also received a funding of $553 million from the United States for a port

205
0:12:15.820000----> 0:12:18.300000
terminal in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo.

206
0:12:18.300000----> 0:12:24.060000
Thirdly, the Abu Dhabi International Holding Company invested $400 million into Adani

207
0:12:24.060000----> 0:12:25.060000
enterprises.

208
0:12:25.060000----> 0:12:30.900000
And lastly, the Qatar Investment Authority or QIA, they acquired a 2.7% ownership in

209
0:12:30.900000----> 0:12:36.620000
Adani green energy valued at $474 million.

210
0:12:36.620000----> 0:12:41.460000
So when the company repaired the debt and got in such big names as investors, it again

211
0:12:41.460000----> 0:12:44.860000
made headlines and they won the trust of the investors.

212
0:12:44.860000----> 0:12:48.780000
And with this money that they got by selling equity, they paid back their debt again to

213
0:12:48.780000----> 0:12:51.220000
make positive headlines.

214
0:12:51.220000----> 0:12:55.500000
So the Adani's addressed the three major allegations outlined in the Hindenburg report,

215
0:12:55.500000----> 0:12:58.820000
which were huge debt, pledging of shares and family control.

216
0:12:58.820000----> 0:13:04.460000
Today, their EBITDA for 9 months of F524 increased by 58% year on year.

217
0:13:04.460000----> 0:13:06.980000
And because of that, their ratios have improved.

218
0:13:06.980000----> 0:13:09.860000
In fact, there is a ratio called the debt to EBITDA ratio.

219
0:13:09.860000----> 0:13:14.460000
And this debt to EBITDA ratio shows how much debt a company has as compared to how much

220
0:13:14.460000----> 0:13:19.100000
money it makes before paying interest, taxes and other expenses.

221
0:13:19.100000----> 0:13:23.780000
So if the ratio is 2, it means that for every one rupee that the company is making, it

222
0:13:23.780000----> 0:13:25.140000
has a debt of 2 rupees.

223
0:13:25.140000----> 0:13:28.500000
So the lower this ratio, the better is the health of the company.

224
0:13:28.500000----> 0:13:33.080000
In this case, the Adani's reduced their debt to EBITDA from 3.8, before the Hindenburg

225
0:13:33.080000----> 0:13:36.220000
report to 2.5 after the report.

226
0:13:36.220000----> 0:13:43.460000
And as of 1st half of 2024, their debt to equity ratios stood at 0.67 as against 1.52

227
0:13:43.460000----> 0:13:44.460000
in FY22.

228
0:13:44.820000----> 0:13:51.140000
Similarly, their debt to service coverage ratio has improved from 1.47 in FY22 to 2.1

229
0:13:51.140000----> 0:13:53.460000
to an H1 of FY24.

230
0:13:53.460000----> 0:13:57.300000
If this is very clear to you, let's move on to the next strategy of the Adani's and

231
0:13:57.300000----> 0:14:01.700000
that is focusing on higher margin business and cutting down on diversification.

232
0:14:01.700000----> 0:14:09.300000
Long story short, the Adani's are majorly focusing on their infra projects and they're

233
0:14:09.300000----> 0:14:11.700000
taking a step back from the FMCG sector.

234
0:14:11.700000----> 0:14:18.460000
And if we see their core infrastructure businesses, 82.8% of their portfolio, which includes energy,

235
0:14:18.460000----> 0:14:24.380000
transport and logistics, they registered a robust 23% year on year growth in EBITDA.

236
0:14:24.380000----> 0:14:29.140000
And now, the Adani group is planning a 7 lakh crore capital expenditure over the next decade

237
0:14:29.140000----> 0:14:31.580000
for expanding its infrastructure business.

238
0:14:31.580000----> 0:14:35.300000
So while they're going extremely bullish on their infrastructure projects, they're

239
0:14:35.300000----> 0:14:41.020000
also discussing a possibility of selling their entire 43.97% stake in the Wilma join

240
0:14:41.020000----> 0:14:42.100000
to venture.

241
0:14:42.100000----> 0:14:46.420000
This is because the profit margin and FMCG business is barely 2-3%.

242
0:14:46.420000----> 0:14:52.020000
Whereas, Adani's ports has a profit margin of 62% and Adani's power has a profit margin

243
0:14:52.020000----> 0:14:53.020000
of 37.7%.

244
0:14:53.020000----> 0:14:59.060000
In fact, the Adani's have become so bullish that the EBITDA of Adani Enterprises has grown

245
0:14:59.060000----> 0:15:01.060000
by 99%.

246
0:15:01.060000----> 0:15:03.420000
Yes, you heard that right.

247
0:15:03.420000----> 0:15:05.700000
It has grown by 99%.

248
0:15:05.700000----> 0:15:09.300000
And here's where we started wondering how did the EBITDA of such a large company increase

249
0:15:09.300000----> 0:15:11.460000
by 99%.

250
0:15:11.460000----> 0:15:13.860000
So you know what, we started digging deeper.

251
0:15:13.860000----> 0:15:19.220000
But the sad factor here is that we couldn't find that, but we found something very interesting.

252
0:15:19.220000----> 0:15:23.060000
We found two projects that the Adani's are pursuing very very aggressively which will

253
0:15:23.060000----> 0:15:28.380000
go on to become projects of national importance and projects of extraordinary advantage for

254
0:15:28.380000----> 0:15:29.380000
the Adani's.

255
0:15:29.380000----> 0:15:32.180000
So the question is, what are these two projects?

256
0:15:32.180000----> 0:15:36.500000
The first project is its B2C Infra business which are airports.

257
0:15:36.500000----> 0:15:41.540000
And in the airport's portfolio, during the quarter of October to December 2023, 90 new

258
0:15:41.540000----> 0:15:45.340000
routes, 9 new airlines and 5 new flights were entered to the portfolio.

259
0:15:45.340000----> 0:15:49.060000
And if you're in Mumbai, you would know that the Greenfield Navi Mumbai project is on track

260
0:15:49.060000----> 0:15:51.860000
for completion in December 2024.

261
0:15:51.860000----> 0:15:59.380000
Navi Mumbai airport is preparing for operational readiness by the December 2024.

262
0:15:59.380000----> 0:16:03.140000
And Ani is among the airport's redefined excellence in aviation.

263
0:16:03.140000----> 0:16:10.020000
Cater to a massive 9 crore passenger per year and 2.5 million tonnes of cargo by 2032.

264
0:16:10.020000----> 0:16:14.220000
Now the reason why this is a very big deal is because the market research says that the

265
0:16:14.220000----> 0:16:18.420000
passenger movement in the Indian airports has increased with an annual number of over

266
0:16:18.420000----> 0:16:19.780000
85 million.

267
0:16:19.780000----> 0:16:25.860000
And currently, the per capita journey by an Indian is 0.1 per capita on an aggregate

268
0:16:25.860000----> 0:16:26.860000
basis.

269
0:16:26.860000----> 0:16:29.860000
Indians on an average take one flight every 10 years.

270
0:16:29.860000----> 0:16:35.100000
And this number is expected to rise to at least 0.6 by 2032.

271
0:16:35.100000----> 0:16:39.860000
So there is expected to be a 6X jump in the overall passenger traffic.

272
0:16:39.860000----> 0:16:43.220000
Which means the airport is a gold mine for the Anandis.

273
0:16:43.220000----> 0:16:47.060000
The second project that I found extremely fascinating is your copper smelter plant.

274
0:16:47.060000----> 0:16:49.500000
And this is a very big win for India also.

275
0:16:49.500000----> 0:16:50.780000
So let's look into it.

276
0:16:50.780000----> 0:16:55.580000
The Adani group is building the world's largest single location copper manufacturing plant

277
0:16:55.580000----> 0:16:57.660000
at the Atmundra in Gujarat.

278
0:16:57.660000----> 0:17:02.380000
The plant with help got India's dependence on imports and aid energy transition as per

279
0:17:02.380000----> 0:17:03.380000
the Adani group.

280
0:17:03.380000----> 0:17:08.620000
If you see the trend of copper trade since the early 2000s, India has been a net exporter

281
0:17:08.620000----> 0:17:09.980000
of copper.

282
0:17:09.980000----> 0:17:14.420000
But since the last 5 years now, India has become a net importer of copper.

283
0:17:14.420000----> 0:17:20.980000
In fact, in FY23, the copper import value rose to a record high of 11,636 crores.

284
0:17:20.980000----> 0:17:25.300000
Whereas in FY18, it was just 1,903 crores.

285
0:17:25.300000----> 0:17:29.060000
So the question we hear is how did we go from being an exporter of copper to such a

286
0:17:29.060000----> 0:17:30.900000
heavy importer of copper?

287
0:17:30.900000----> 0:17:34.540000
Well, firstly, the demand of copper is increasing because of EVs.

288
0:17:34.540000----> 0:17:39.820000
So electric vehicles use at least 2.5 times more copper as compared to the internal combustion

289
0:17:39.820000----> 0:17:41.260000
engine vehicles.

290
0:17:41.260000----> 0:17:46.500000
The second reason is that the market is facing a copper shortage because Sturlight's Tuthukudi

291
0:17:46.500000----> 0:17:48.620000
unit got shut down due to protests.

292
0:17:48.620000----> 0:17:53.780000
This plant was so important for India that it contributed nearly 40% of India's total

293
0:17:53.780000----> 0:17:54.940000
copper production.

294
0:17:54.940000----> 0:17:58.980000
So now, we are importing copper instead of exporting copper.

295
0:17:58.980000----> 0:18:07.300000
On May 22, the protests in Tamil Nadu's Tuthukaran reached 100 days.

296
0:18:07.300000----> 0:18:11.220000
They want Vedanta Limited's business unit, Sturlight Copper Plant to be shut.

297
0:18:11.220000----> 0:18:17.020000
Vedanta pointed out that the copper smelter caters to 40% of India's demand for copper,

298
0:18:17.020000----> 0:18:23.060000
even as it is of course a national asset and would be of course very crucial to the nation's

299
0:18:23.060000----> 0:18:25.380000
copper demand and supply of course.

300
0:18:25.380000----> 0:18:26.860000
But this is where the Adanes came in.

301
0:18:26.860000----> 0:18:32.540000
They are building a copper smelter plant with 500,000 tons of capacity at a massive cost

302
0:18:32.540000----> 0:18:35.220000
of $1.2 billion.

303
0:18:35.220000----> 0:18:37.860000
This is being done in Mundra in Gujarat.

304
0:18:37.860000----> 0:18:41.780000
So this is not just good for the Adanes but even for India.

305
0:18:41.780000----> 0:18:47.220000
This is one of the major reasons why India can again become a net exporter of copper.

306
0:18:47.220000----> 0:18:51.260000
So again, the Adanes just built the perfect business at the perfect time.

307
0:18:51.260000----> 0:18:54.740000
This is the third strategy that the Adanes are deploying which is less focus on low

308
0:18:54.740000----> 0:18:59.420000
margin business and very high focus on growing and futuristic business.

309
0:18:59.420000----> 0:19:02.700000
And lastly, the Adanes are slowing down on their expansion through debt.

310
0:19:02.700000----> 0:19:04.700000
So if you read the news, you would know that.

311
0:19:04.700000----> 0:19:10.660000
Adani Enterprises has cancelled the acquisition of 2 road assets which was valued at $375 million.

312
0:19:10.660000----> 0:19:16.100000
Then the Adanes were in talks with devi power to buy a 1200 watt power plant.

313
0:19:16.100000----> 0:19:18.100000
But again, that also got cancelled.

314
0:19:18.100000----> 0:19:21.860000
So this way, they are exposed to new risky projects is decreasing because of which they

315
0:19:21.860000----> 0:19:24.020000
don't need to pledge more shares.

316
0:19:24.020000----> 0:19:27.780000
At the same time, because their business is growing due to more focus, they are able

317
0:19:27.780000----> 0:19:30.260000
to steadily grip the market.

318
0:19:30.260000----> 0:19:34.380000
This is all by paying off their debt before the schedule date, by unplaging their shares,

319
0:19:34.380000----> 0:19:38.860000
by focusing on their core business, by onboarding big investors to get credibility.

320
0:19:38.860000----> 0:19:44.140000
And lastly, by slowing down the debt-backed expansion, the Adanes came back even stronger

321
0:19:44.140000----> 0:19:47.140000
in the Indian market after the Hindenburg report.

322
0:19:47.140000----> 0:19:50.460000
And cherry on the cake, even the Supreme Court has already given a clean shit to the

323
0:19:50.460000----> 0:19:53.980000
group and the allegations made by the Hindenburg report.

324
0:19:53.980000----> 0:19:58.020000
So again, this further boosted the investors' confidence in the Adani group.

325
0:19:58.020000----> 0:20:00.980000
And this brings us to the last part of the episode and that are the business lessons

326
0:20:00.980000----> 0:20:03.660000
that you need to learn from all this drama.

327
0:20:03.660000----> 0:20:04.660000
Lesson number 1.

328
0:20:04.660000----> 0:20:08.180000
In this world of information warfare, it is very very important to know how to play your

329
0:20:08.180000----> 0:20:10.980000
cards and turn information into your advantage.

330
0:20:10.980000----> 0:20:15.580000
In this case, just like the Hindenburg used information to attack the Adanes, the Adanes

331
0:20:15.580000----> 0:20:19.420000
prevented a vicious cycle with early debt repayments which eventually gained investor

332
0:20:19.420000----> 0:20:20.420000
confidence.

333
0:20:20.420000----> 0:20:23.140000
The second business lesson actually comes from a very close friend of mine whose name

334
0:20:23.140000----> 0:20:24.140000
is Neil.

335
0:20:24.140000----> 0:20:28.500000
And he told me last week that while good business leaders cultivate a great relationship while

336
0:20:28.500000----> 0:20:33.300000
doing business, great business leaders cultivate a great business relationship with the right

337
0:20:33.300000----> 0:20:37.340000
people even when there is no business transaction.

338
0:20:37.340000----> 0:20:42.140000
Because this cultivation of a meaningful relationship with the right people beyond transactions

339
0:20:42.140000----> 0:20:45.020000
can help you get an extraordinary advantage.

340
0:20:45.020000----> 0:20:49.500000
In this case, the Adanes had investment houses from Qatar and Abu Dhabi to help them out

341
0:20:49.500000----> 0:20:53.700000
because they had a meaningful relationship beyond their routine business.

342
0:20:53.700000----> 0:20:58.340000
So as a business owner, the one question that you need to ask yourself is, how are you building

343
0:20:58.340000----> 0:21:02.100000
a high quality relationship which goes beyond transactions.

344
0:21:02.100000----> 0:21:06.340000
And lastly, once a great man said, when the world throws bricks at you, you can either

345
0:21:06.340000----> 0:21:10.860000
face them mindlessly and let them hit your face or you could use the same bricks and

346
0:21:10.860000----> 0:21:12.860000
build a castle for yourself.

347
0:21:12.860000----> 0:21:17.660000
In this case, the Adanes used the Hindenburg reports analysis to improve themselves so

348
0:21:17.660000----> 0:21:22.820000
much that now the investors seem to have more confidence in them than before.

349
0:21:22.820000----> 0:21:26.140000
And I just hope you learned something very very valuable from this case study.

350
0:21:26.140000----> 0:21:27.740000
