0:00:00----> 0:00:07.320000
I'm Sam and today we are looking at the difference between every time and all the time.

2
0:00:07.320000----> 0:00:13.440000
We use all the time to talk about something that always or usually happens.

3
0:00:13.440000----> 0:00:19.760000
For example, many people think that in the UK it rains all the time.

4
0:00:19.760000----> 0:00:22.640000
And yes, it does rain a lot.

5
0:00:22.640000----> 0:00:29.760000
We use every time when we are talking about each individual time something happens.

6
0:00:29.760000----> 0:00:34.920000
For example, every time I go to the beach it rains.

7
0:00:34.920000----> 0:00:42.840000
We don't know how often I go to the beach, but each individual time I go it rains.

8
0:00:42.840000----> 0:00:47.520000
There, we hope you learn something every time you watch one of these videos.

9
0:00:47.520000----> 0:00:52.040000
Hi everybody, I'm James and welcome back to this week's English in a Minute.

10
0:00:52.040000----> 0:00:56.440000
This week we're going to look at the differences between actually and at the moment.

11
0:00:56.440000----> 0:01:00.680000
These two phrases are often confused, so let's take a look at an example.

12
0:01:00.680000----> 0:01:05.440000
At the moment I'm making this programme, but actually I should be in a meeting.

13
0:01:05.440000----> 0:01:10
So this sentence shows both phrases, but they're actually quite different.

14
0:01:10----> 0:01:11.440000
Let's break it down.

15
0:01:11.440000----> 0:01:13.880000
At the moment I'm making this programme.

16
0:01:13.880000----> 0:01:17.360000
As you can see, I'm making this programme right now.

17
0:01:17.360000----> 0:01:21.240000
So at the moment means now or in the present.

18
0:01:21.240000----> 0:01:24.160000
But actually I should be in a meeting.

19
0:01:24.160000----> 0:01:29.680000
Now in this part of my sentence, actually isn't talking about time at all.

20
0:01:29.680000----> 0:01:32.680000
Actually means in fact or in reality.

21
0:01:32.680000----> 0:01:36.800000
So if you want to talk about now, say at the moment.

22
0:01:36.800000----> 0:01:40.240000
But if you want to say in reality, say actually.

23
0:01:40.240000----> 0:01:45.600000
At the moment I want to go and make a coffee, but actually I think I'll go back to my desk.

24
0:01:45.600000----> 0:01:46.600000
Bye.

25
0:01:46.600000----> 0:01:48.680000
Hello ladies and gentlemen.

26
0:01:48.680000----> 0:01:50.880000
Tom here at the BBC Learning English.

27
0:01:50.880000----> 0:01:57.840000
Today I'm going to explain the difference between everyone and anyone.

28
0:01:57.840000----> 0:02:05.920000
When I say hello everyone, I'm talking to all the people in a group or all the people

29
0:02:05.920000----> 0:02:07.880000
watching this video.

30
0:02:07.880000----> 0:02:14.560000
Anyone however relates to any one individual person in a group.

31
0:02:14.560000----> 0:02:18.320000
And we often use it to ask questions.

32
0:02:18.320000----> 0:02:26.840000
For example, is anyone listening or can anyone answer today's question?

33
0:02:26.840000----> 0:02:32.160000
Here I'm asking if any individuals in the group are listening.

34
0:02:32.160000----> 0:02:39.040000
If the whole group is listening, we can say yes, everyone is listening.

35
0:02:39.040000----> 0:02:42.880000
Which is something that English teachers love to hear.

36
0:02:42.880000----> 0:02:43.880000
Hi everyone.

37
0:02:43.880000----> 0:02:48.120000
I'm Saskia and in this episode we're going to look at what it means when we at the

38
0:02:48.120000----> 0:02:50.600000
word ever to the end of a question word.

39
0:02:50.600000----> 0:02:55.120000
The most important thing to know is that when we add ever to a question word, it's not talking

40
0:02:55.120000----> 0:02:57.120000
about anything specific.

41
0:02:57.120000----> 0:03:02.160000
It often means we don't know the who or the where or they are not important.

42
0:03:02.160000----> 0:03:04.040000
Let's look at some examples.

43
0:03:04.040000----> 0:03:06.880000
Whoever ate my cake is in big trouble.

44
0:03:06.880000----> 0:03:10.800000
This example means that I do not know who ate my cake.

45
0:03:10.800000----> 0:03:15
Whenever I go to the cafe, there are never any sandwiches left.

46
0:03:15----> 0:03:18.680000
This means the time when I go to the cafe is not important.

47
0:03:18.680000----> 0:03:22.840000
I never put on weight so I can eat whatever I like.

48
0:03:22.840000----> 0:03:25.920000
This means what I eat isn't important.

49
0:03:25.920000----> 0:03:29.040000
The puppy followed the girl wherever she went.

50
0:03:29.040000----> 0:03:33.400000
By adding ever to where, it means the place is not important.

51
0:03:33.400000----> 0:03:39.120000
So if you want to say the time, place, person or thing you're talking about is not important

52
0:03:39.120000----> 0:03:42.920000
or unknown, just add ever to the correct question word.

53
0:03:42.920000----> 0:03:44.520000
Hi everyone.

54
0:03:44.520000----> 0:03:48.400000
What's the difference between maybe and may be?

55
0:03:48.400000----> 0:03:52.440000
Well, we're going to find out in this English in a minute.

56
0:03:52.440000----> 0:03:57.440000
May is used to express possibility, usually not a very certain one.

57
0:03:57.440000----> 0:04:01.440000
It's a modal verb so it's always followed by a bare infinitive.

58
0:04:01.440000----> 0:04:05.320000
The bare infinitive of be is be.

59
0:04:05.320000----> 0:04:08.480000
Using the two together, we can make a sentence.

60
0:04:08.480000----> 0:04:11.720000
Don't call her, she may be at work.

61
0:04:11.800000----> 0:04:14.480000
Now, maybe is just one word.

62
0:04:14.480000----> 0:04:17.520000
It's an adverb and it has a few uses.

63
0:04:17.520000----> 0:04:21
Most commonly it means perhaps or possibly.

64
0:04:21----> 0:04:24.600000
In this case, it's often the first word in the sentence.

65
0:04:24.600000----> 0:04:28.160000
Don't call her, maybe she's at work.

66
0:04:28.160000----> 0:04:33.600000
However, put it in front of an amount to mean around or approximately.

67
0:04:33.600000----> 0:04:38.720000
This video will be seen by, ooh, maybe a million people?

68
0:04:38.720000----> 0:04:41
Make it happen people.

69
0:04:41----> 0:04:45.720000
Hi, I'm Phil and I'm going to tell you the difference between go on doing

70
0:04:45.720000----> 0:04:48.120000
and go on to do something.

71
0:04:48.120000----> 0:04:54.360000
Now, the meaning of go on depends on whether it's followed by the gerund or the infinitive.

72
0:04:54.360000----> 0:05:01.200000
So if we have go on doing, that's the gerund, it means to continue doing something.

73
0:05:01.200000----> 0:05:06.920000
So for example, I'd like to go on talking now or I really like this city.

74
0:05:06.920000----> 0:05:09.760000
I'd like to go on living here for years.

75
0:05:09.840000----> 0:05:15.800000
Go on to do, that's the infinitive, means to progress on to something.

76
0:05:15.800000----> 0:05:23.880000
For example, I'd like to go on to study more languages or you could go on to have an even better job.

77
0:05:23.880000----> 0:05:31.400000
Just remember that if you go on doing something, you don't change and if you go on to do something, you do change.

78
0:05:31.400000----> 0:05:38.800000
So, if you go on practising your English, you'll go on to be even better than you are now.

79
0:05:38.840000----> 0:05:42.400000
Welcome everyone, Sam from BBC Learning English here.

80
0:05:42.400000----> 0:05:48.840000
You probably already know that in English we have some verbs that are always followed by the infinitive,

81
0:05:48.840000----> 0:05:54.480000
for example, want and other verbs that are always followed by the gerund.

82
0:05:54.480000----> 0:05:56.640000
For example, enjoy.

83
0:05:56.640000----> 0:06:05.600000
But we also have some verbs in English that can be followed by either the infinitive or the gerund and the meaning will change.

84
0:06:05.600000----> 0:06:08.080000
For example, remember.

85
0:06:08.080000----> 0:06:16.120000
Remember to bring your umbrella where first you remember and then you bring your umbrella.

86
0:06:16.120000----> 0:06:19.600000
This is commonly used when talking about the future.

87
0:06:19.600000----> 0:06:28.760000
I remember meeting my best friend when I was little, where first I met my best friend and then I remembered it.

88
0:06:28.760000----> 0:06:34.240000
This is now a memory, so it's commonly used when talking about the past.

89
0:06:34.320000----> 0:06:41.600000
Hi, I'm Tim and I'm going to tell you the difference between two and enough when we use them as adverbs.

90
0:06:41.600000----> 0:06:45.760000
They refer to quantity, but there's an important difference.

91
0:06:45.760000----> 0:06:51.280000
Enough is usually positive. It means that something is suitable or sufficient.

92
0:06:51.280000----> 0:06:56.240000
Oh, great! This t-shirt's big enough. It'll fit me perfectly.

93
0:06:56.240000----> 0:06:59.360000
It's colourful enough for my sister's party.

94
0:06:59.360000----> 0:07:06.960000
Two usually has a negative meaning. It's used to say that something is a problem or it's unsuitable in some way.

95
0:07:06.960000----> 0:07:11.440000
Oh no, this is too short. I can't wear this.

96
0:07:11.440000----> 0:07:14.400000
It's too late to find anything else to wear.

97
0:07:14.400000----> 0:07:21.200000
So if we have enough, it's probably a good thing, but if you see two, it's a bad thing.

98
0:07:21.200000----> 0:07:24.960000
Let's learn some common uses of the word present.

99
0:07:25.040000----> 0:07:29.840000
Firstly, present as a noun is another word to mean gift.

100
0:07:29.840000----> 0:07:32.960000
What's the best present you've ever received?

101
0:07:32.960000----> 0:07:42.480000
Present can also be used as a noun to mean now, this very minute, often with the, the present.

102
0:07:42.480000----> 0:07:46.960000
Stop talking about the future and start living in the present.

103
0:07:47.040000----> 0:07:52.240000
We also use present as an adjective to mean in a particular place.

104
0:07:52.240000----> 0:07:55.520000
I was present for all seven classes.

105
0:07:55.520000----> 0:08:01.360000
This word can also be used as a verb, but listen to the difference in pronunciation.

106
0:08:02.080000----> 0:08:07.040000
Present. Present can mean show something to someone.

107
0:08:07.040000----> 0:08:12.560000
It's quite formal. You can present research or information in a meeting.

108
0:08:12.560000----> 0:08:16.640000
I presented the results of the survey to the rest of the team.

109
0:08:16.720000----> 0:08:23.200000
Finally, present can also be used as a verb to mean introduce someone to others.

110
0:08:23.200000----> 0:08:25.280000
I'd like to present my friend Nick.

111
0:08:46.640000----> 0:08:50.800000
But you never ever say I have an appointment with my friends.

112
0:08:50.800000----> 0:08:54.800000
That's too formal. Now, to talk about appointments with friends,

113
0:08:54.800000----> 0:08:58.800000
we simply say I'm meeting my friends this weekend.

114
0:08:58.800000----> 0:09:05.120000
So it's meet someone, have an appointment, remember meet someone.

115
0:09:05.120000----> 0:09:09.040000
And I'll meet you next week.
