1
0:00:00----> 0:00:02.100000
Well, let's focus on ITC.

2
0:00:02.100000----> 0:00:08.680000
As Namesh was telling us earlier, the block from a bad that is British tobacco is sort

3
0:00:08.680000----> 0:00:11.320000
of like it has come to the market soon.

4
0:00:11.320000----> 0:00:17.120000
I mean, I think the offer perhaps opens later today and should get done tomorrow.

5
0:00:17.120000----> 0:00:18.120000
That seems to be the timeline.

6
0:00:18.120000----> 0:00:19.120000
Namesh, tell us more.

7
0:00:19.120000----> 0:00:23.440000
Yes, Pashant, that's the timeline which the market is anticipating that the block will

8
0:00:23.440000----> 0:00:26.960000
come potentially today evening and get executed tomorrow morning.

9
0:00:26.960000----> 0:00:30.600000
Now, a bad is looking to sell up to 4% stake in ITC Limited.

10
0:00:30.600000----> 0:00:33.680000
At the current price, the deal works out to close to 20,000 crores.

11
0:00:33.680000----> 0:00:36.960000
So it's a large block which is going to hit the market now.

12
0:00:36.960000----> 0:00:40.400000
If you look at the shearling pattern, the mutual funds combined own close to 10%.

13
0:00:40.400000----> 0:00:44.040000
Insurance companies own 20%, but out of that, LIC is the largest holder.

14
0:00:44.040000----> 0:00:46.280000
They continue to own 15% stake.

15
0:00:46.280000----> 0:00:53.680000
There is SUTI who continues to own 7.8% and the FIS continue to combine own close to 39%.

16
0:00:53.680000----> 0:00:58.200000
Now, the big question is will the block deal mean any changes as far as the MSA weight

17
0:00:58.200000----> 0:01:01.120000
is concerned and the feedback seems to be a no.

18
0:01:01.120000----> 0:01:06.480000
Reason being, that is classified as an FDA investor and not as a not classified as promoters.

19
0:01:06.480000----> 0:01:12.400000
So even if the sell 4.8% stake, there is an anywhere in FPI cap of close to 24% in ITC.

20
0:01:12.400000----> 0:01:17.560000
So it's not going to change the mood much and while the block will get executed, looks

21
0:01:17.560000----> 0:01:20.080000
like there will be a discount as well.

22
0:01:20.080000----> 0:01:23.840000
But the discount could be around 6.8%.

23
0:01:23.840000----> 0:01:27.840000
But after the block, there is no likelihood to be a big change in the MSCI.

24
0:01:27.840000----> 0:01:33.120000
But from a deal perspective, the SUTI is anticipating that the book may get launched

25
0:01:33.120000----> 0:01:36.800000
today evening and we will get executed tomorrow.

26
0:01:36.800000----> 0:01:41
The question in image though is in terms of just the sense, we won't know.

27
0:01:41----> 0:01:44.120000
We know about this, but they own 29%.

28
0:01:44.120000----> 0:01:46.520000
I mean, is this it?

29
0:01:46.520000----> 0:01:50.160000
Is also one other question which people will ponder, right?

30
0:01:50.160000----> 0:01:55.840000
So Prashant, in case of BAD, they have already communicated in their annual report as well

31
0:01:55.840000----> 0:02:00.280000
and to the investors that they look to sell up to 4% and they want to retain 25%.

32
0:02:00.280000----> 0:02:03.800000
So two ways to read this, one, there is a large block.

33
0:02:03.800000----> 0:02:07
But there could be end of the overhang as well.

34
0:02:07----> 0:02:11.120000
If they sell the entire 4%, then there could be no further selling from BAD.

35
0:02:11.120000----> 0:02:15.280000
So and remember, as you also write the pointer in the morning, the stock has corrected sharply

36
0:02:15.280000----> 0:02:17.880000
from the recent highs of 500 to almost 400 now.

37
0:02:17.880000----> 0:02:20.240000
So some bit of that is in the price as well.

38
0:02:20.240000----> 0:02:24.160000
Once the block is executed and there is a good buying interest from large institutions,

39
0:02:24.160000----> 0:02:26.440000
you might say a bit of a pullback as well.

40
0:02:26.440000----> 0:02:27.560000
Absolutely.

41
0:02:27.560000----> 0:02:32.880000
I mean, we've seen those right when the block gets done and fully subscribed,

42
0:02:32.880000----> 0:02:34
there is strong demand.

43
0:02:34----> 0:02:37.360000
I mean, the move has been to the upside in many cases.

44
0:02:37.360000----> 0:02:38.040000
So we'll see.

45
0:02:38.040000----> 0:02:39.200000
This is a large one.

46
0:02:39.200000----> 0:02:40.800000
And I mean, thanks very much for that.
